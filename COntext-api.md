*If the examiner asks you to "Create a context that allows values to be passed... without using props," this is the exact code they want to see. You demonstrated:*

- ***`createContext()`**: To build the "Broadcast Station."*
    
- ***`Board.Provider`**: To "Wrap" the children so they can hear the signal.*
    
- ***`useContext(Board)`**: To "Listen" to the signal in a completely different file.*
