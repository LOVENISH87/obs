## Correct movement patterns (memorize this table)

| Goal           | Movement           |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Adjacent pairs | `i += 2`, `j += 2` |
| Full reverse   | `i++`, `j--`       |
| Sliding window | `i++`, `j++`       |
| Skip one       | `i++`, `j += 2`    |


### 🔥 **THE RULE**

> **If you access `arr[i + k]`, your loop must stop at `n - k - 1`.**

> declare -> string msg;

> assigning -> giving value to declared msg (var)!



# XOR -> 
XOR Properties:
- a ^ a = 0 (anything XORed with itself = 0)
- a ^ 0 = a (anything XORed with 0 = itself)
- XOR is associative and commutative

# BIT WISE OPERATOR

left << 1;
for(bit = 0 ; bit <= 32; i++){
	1 << bit!!!
	this will -> initially bit is 0 so we do the above operation 1 << 0 -> 1;
	1 << 1 => 2;
	1 << 2 -> 4; 
because it just means 2 power bit!!!  (2^bit)
```
1 << 0 = 0001  (1)
1 << 1 = 0010  (2)
1 << 2 = 0100  (4)
1 << 3 = 1000  (8)
1 << bit = 2^bit
```

}
