- ??? hashset is a hashmap where the val is always the same???  
- for the time being hashset has <mark class="hltr-sky blue">only two operations</mark> like <mark class="hltr-love">contains</mark> and <mark class="hltr-cyan">remove</mark>!!!
again it generated hash-keys (objects) and position into the table!!!

# each time you check for or look for keys, its hash is computed and the bucket is in the table and referenced directly 


<h1 style = "color:pink">hashset contains keys !! nothing else!!! </h1>
<h3 style="color:green" > so the .contins() operation => O(1)</h3>
<h3 style="color:red" > so the .remove() operation => O(n)</h3>
- hashset is faster then arrayList in java!!!

# hashSet is a set so  no DUPLICAtes!!! at all while arrayList allows dups!!
